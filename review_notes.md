# Review notes

Two brief points: 

First, thank you for reading my paper and sending it out for review. Please also thank the reviewers for their comments; these have improved the paper.  

Second, I am glad that the article's argument has not been challenged. All three reviewers agree that the effects of job mobility have received little attention; all three reviewers agree that few papers compare and contrast quits and promotions as competing mechanisms for rewarding workers; all three reviewers agree that quits and promotions should have fundamentally different effects on workers. Although reviewer 3 challenges some hypotheses, the main aim of the paper has been accepted by all. This is encouraging.

Below, I comment on the issues raised, and outline how the original submission changed.

Reviewer 3:
