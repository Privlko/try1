# Review notes

Two brief points: 

First, thank you for reading my paper and sending it out for review. Please also thank the reviewers for their comments; these have improved the paper.  

Second, I am glad that the article's argument has not been challenged. All three reviewers agree that the effects of job mobility have received little attention; all three reviewers agree that few papers compare and contrast quits and promotions as competing mechanisms for rewarding workers; all three reviewers agree that quits and promotions should have fundamentally different effects on workers. Although reviewer 3 challenges some hypotheses, the main aim of the paper has been accepted by all. This is encouraging.

Below, I comment on the issues raised, and outline how the original submission changed.

Reviewer 1:

* I reviewed the methodology to reflect this comment. In my opinion, at least some limitations of FE estimation should be considered. 

*  Fixed -effects estimation is only robust to ommitted variable bias if the variable is time-constant, as reviewer 2 notes. Time variant ommitted variables can lead to biased estimates, especially when these correlate with a theoretically important predictor (like job mobility); I note this throughout the article but I have made it explicitly clear in the update version.

* I accept this point. I update the paper to include the results of 6 hausmann tests; these show a correlation in between-within effects for several estimates. This rules out unbiased estimates using random-effects modelling, and confirms the need for a different approach; the use of fixed-effects is therefore justified.

* An additional table of estimates is now included, listing the full output. These may be included as an appendix.

* An additional table is added, it includes the descriptive statistics of each measure. 

* *"How can country level variables survive a within transformation in a fixed-effects model when they donâ€™t vary across individuals in a given survey year"* These measures were added because they vary within individual-level clusters, over time. Hence they capture the person-specific changes which come with changes in unemployment and growth. It is precisely because they don't vary accross individuals that they are included. Gesthuizen 2009 makes a similar decision writing in the International Journal of Manpower.

* This is a legitimate concern, which warrants attention. The basic answer is that these outcomes often appear in articles exploring the effects of mobility. 

* I have rewritten key sections of the paper to include a reference to earnings and working conditions.

* This is also a legitimate concern. I briefly consider the importance of ordinal regression. Since the output is similar, I committ to linear regression. 








Reviewer 2: I am grateful to reviewer two for their positive comments. One issue raised by the review, is the weakness of the paper's policy implications. I've considered these and read through existing policy suggestions tied to mobility. The paper's argument has been updated. 


Reviewer 3:
