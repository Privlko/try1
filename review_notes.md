# Review notes

Two brief points: 

First, thank you for reading my paper and sending it out for review. Please also thank the reviewers for their comments which I think have strengthened the paper.  

Second, I am glad that the central argument has not been challenged. All three reviewers agree that the effects of job mobility have received little attention; all three agree that we should compare and contrast quits and promotions agains each other; all three agree that quits and promotions should have different effects. Although R3 takes issue with some hypotheses, the two aims of the paper seem accepted by all. I think this is really encouraging.

In the next section, I comment on the issues raised and outline how the original submission has changed.

## Reviewer 1:

R1 seems mostly concerned with the methodology. The overall argument of Quits and Ladders appears to be accepted. However, the concerns raised are legitimate and warrant attention:

* I review the methodology to reflect this comment. In my opinion, at least some limitations of FE estimation should be considered. I am happy to remove these at the request of the editor. The fact that ommitted variable bias is an issue for most forms of estimation seems to me unimportant, the methodology is focused on linear FE specifically. 

*  Fixed-effects estimation is only robust to ommitted variable bias if the variable is time-constant, as both myself and reviewer 2 note. Time variant ommitted variables can lead to biased estimates, especially when these correlate with a theoretically important predictor (like job mobility); I note this throughout the article but have decided emphasise it in the updated version.

* I accept this point. I update the paper to include the results of 6 hausmann tests; these show a correlation in between-within effects for several estimates. The results rule-out unbiased estimates using random-effects modelling, and confirm the need for a different approach. The use of fixed-effects estimation is therefore justified.

* An additional table of estimates is now included, listing the full output. It may be included as an appendix.

* An additional table is added, it includes the descriptive statistics of each measure. 

* *"How can country level variables survive a within transformation in a fixed-effects model when they don’t vary across individuals in a given survey year"* These measures were added because they vary within individual-level clusters over time. Hence they capture the average, person-specific, change which comes with changes in unemployment and growth. It is precisely because they don't vary accross individuals that they are included. Gesthuizen 2009 makes a similar decision writing in the International Journal of Manpower.

* This is a legitimate concern. The basic answer is that these outcomes often appear in articles exploring the effects of mobility. 

* I have rewritten key sections of the paper to include a reference to earnings and conditions or job-fit.

* This is a legitimate concern. I briefly consider the importance of ordinal regression. Since the output is similar, I committ to linear regression, which is used also for working time and gross pay.


## Reviewer 2: 

I am grateful to reviewer two for their positive comments. However, a concern about the practical implications of the study is raised. I expand this section of the paper; hopefully this fixes the issue. 


## Reviewer 3:

Reviewer 3 is mostly concerned with the paper's literature review. Here too, the general argument about mobility is accepted and encouraged. R3 also makes nine literature recommendations; I thoroughly read all of these and found them interesting and of a high quality. However, I think it's worth making three observations before turning to specific comments made by R3. 

First, all of the suggested articles are from the field of Personel Psychology. While this field is important, the framework used in Q&L sits in the field of economics and sociology, and cites work that sit in this approach. Both have justifications for why workers move, which are subtly different to those discussed in Personnel Psychology. Although some similarities exist between Psychology and Sociology regardin the topic, most of the articles considered in the literature review rely on either the job-match or job-search approach.

Second, all of the suggested papers consider the importance of push-factors on mobility. Hence, each paper explores and considers the impact of satisfaction on mobility, not the effects of mobility on satisfaction. I think this trend is a pitfall; I note this in the paper and specifically try to turn attention away from predicting mobility to the effects of mobility. R3 acknowledges that such articles are rare, even in their own field. 

Third, the suggested articles seem unconcerned with the relationship between mobility and satisfaction. In fact, several authors use satisfaction as a proxy for "desireability to move". In contrast, both job-match and job-search approaches specifically outline a link between earnigns and mobility, and job-fit and mobility. In these works, I think that satisfaction holds a more meaningful predictive power, where more specific relationships can be hypothesised. This is especially true with the reservation wage concept, found in the job-search approach. Nonetheless, some faults noted by R3 warrant attention. I now turn to these.

* This point is noted. However, my literature review notes several studies where internal and external mobility yields significantly different results, including Gesthuizen 2009 with the International Journal of Manpower, and Tahlin. R3 cites Jackofsky and L. Peters (1983) when making the point. However, this article focused on the significance of satisfaction on models predicting internal and external mobility. It is true that dissatisfaction had a stronger effect on internal mobility; however my paper is more concerned with mobility's effects after the fact. Jackofsky amd Peters seem uninterested in the question and even make the following assumption *“It is reasonable to believe that intra- and interorganizational movement are similar with regard to their impact on individuals”*. This is the exact point my article tries to challenge. 

* Mobley makes an interesting set of observations regarding intention to quit and the cost of quitting. However the same pitfall emerges; the approach of the paper is satisfactions' effect on quitting, not the potential effects of quitting on satisfaction. R3 notes the importance of "desire for change" and "opportunity for change". These concepts are important in their own field, but may be less applicable to theoretical models which try to learn about the effects of quitting. 

* Ng's work features in the original submission.

* This point is noted, I emphasise the brief discussion of involuntary or forced mobility.

* R3 suggests there are several articles which consider the consequences of mobility, but does not include these. R3 also takes exception with hypothesis 2. Internal and external mobility will yield different effects on satsifaction and earnings. I cite the work of Tahlin, Gesthuizen, and Pavlopoulos when offering the hypothesis, all such works have found a similar result and have questioned why types of ombility bring about different effects. R3 cites Carnicer, Sanchez, Perez and Jimenez; a paper that argues that subjective feelings about work are strong predictors of internal mobility. Further, the study is cross-sectional which suggests the authors explore satsifaction as a predictor of movers and non-movers. This paper does not consider the consequences of mobility, and so I find R3's issues slightly confusing.

* This point is noted and accepted, I take greater care in justifying the methodology.

* This point is also accepted, a hausmann test is included which justifies the use of fixed-effects estimation.

* I accept the point regarding practical implications, I expand this section. 

* The point on language is noted; parts of the article have been toned down to accommodate R3.
