# Review notes
I'd like to make two brief comments before addressing reviewers. 

Firstly, thank you for reading my paper and sending it out for review. Please also thank the three reviewers who read and commented on the work. Their suggestions have improved the paper, and they have given me a lot to consider regarding the wider job-mobility debates. 

Secondly, I am glad to note that the article's key argument has not been challenged. All three reviewers agree that the consequences of job mobility are under-developed; all three reviewers agree that there is a gap in studies which compare and contrast the effects of quits and promotions; all three reviewers agree that quits and promotions have fundamentally different effects on earnings and working conditions. Although reviewer 3 challenges some hypotheses, the aim of the work appears to be accepted by all. This is encouraging.

Below, I comment on the issues raised, and outline how the original submission has changed.

Reviewer 1:

Reviewer 2: I am grateful to reviewer two for their positive comments. One issue raised by the review, is the weakness of the paper's policy implications. I've considered these and read through existing policy suggestions tied to mobility. The paper's argument has been updated. 


Reviewer 3:
