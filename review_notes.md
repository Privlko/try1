# Review notes

Two brief points: 

First, thank you for reading my paper and sending it out for review. Please also thank the reviewers for their comments; these have improved the paper.  

Second, I am glad that the article's argument has not been challenged. All three reviewers agree that the effects of job mobility have received little attention; all three reviewers agree that few papers compare and contrast quits and promotions as competing mechanisms which reward workers; all three reviewers agree that quits and promotions should have fundamentally different effects on workers. Although reviewer 3 challenges some hypotheses, the main aim of the paper is accepted by all. This is encouraging.

Below, I comment on the issues raised, and outline how the original submission changed.

## Reviewer 1:

Reviewer 1 seems mostly concerned with the methodology of the paper. The overall argument of Quits and Ladders appears to be accepted. However, the concerns raised are legitimate and warrant attention. The following changes appear in the newest version:

* I review the methodology to reflect this comment. In my opinion, at least some limitations of FE estimation should be considered. I am happy to remove these at the request of the editor. The fact that ommitted variable bias is an issue for most forms of estimation seems unimportant, the methodology is focused on FE specifically. 

*  Fixed-effects estimation is only robust to ommitted variable bias if the variable is time-constant, as both myself and reviewer 2 have noted. Time variant ommitted variables can lead to biased estimates, especially when these correlate with a theoretically important predictor (like job mobility); I note this throughout the article but have decided emphasise it in the updated version.

* I accept this point. I update the paper to include the results of 6 hausmann tests; these show a correlation in between-within effects for several estimates. The results rule-out unbiased estimates using random-effects modelling, and confirm the need for a different approach. The use of fixed-effects estimation is therefore justified.

* An additional table of estimates is now included, listing the full output. It may be included as an appendix.

* An additional table is added, it includes the descriptive statistics of each measure. 

* *"How can country level variables survive a within transformation in a fixed-effects model when they donâ€™t vary across individuals in a given survey year"* These measures were added because they vary within individual-level clusters over time. Hence they capture the average, person-specific change which comes with changes in unemployment and growth. It is precisely because they don't vary accross individuals that they are included. Gesthuizen 2009 makes a similar decision writing in the International Journal of Manpower.

* This is a legitimate concern, which warrants attention. The basic answer is that these outcomes often appear in articles exploring the effects of mobility. 

* I have rewritten key sections of the paper to include a reference to earnings and working conditions.

* This is also a legitimate concern. I briefly consider the importance of ordinal regression. Since the output is similar, I committ to linear regression, which is used also for working time and gross pay.


## Reviewer 2: 

I am grateful to reviewer two for their positive comments. However, a concern about the practical implications of the study is raised. I expand this section of the paper; hopefully this fixes the issue. 


## Reviewer 3:

Reviewer 3 is mostly concerned with the paper's literature review. Here too, the general argument about mobility is accepted and encouraged. R3 also makes nine literature recommendations; I have thoroughly read all of these and have found them interesting and of a high quality. However, it is worth making three observations, before turning to specific comments made by R3. 

First, all of the suggested articles are from the field of Personel Psychology. While this field is important, the framework I use in Q&L sits in the field of economics and sociology. Both have their own justifications for why workers move, which are different to those discussed in Personnel Psychology. Although some similarities exist, most of the articles considered in the literature review rely on the job-matching, and job-searching approaches.

Second, all of the suggested papers consider the importance of push-factors on mobility. Hence, each paper explores and considers the impact of satisfaction on mobility, not the effects of mobility on satisfaction. I consider this a pitfall, as noted in the original paper; I specifically try to turn attention away from predicting mobility, on to the effects of mobility. R3 acknowledges that such articles are rare, even in their field.   

Third, the suggested articles seem mostly unconcerned with the relationship between mobility and satisfaction. In fact, several authors simply use subjective satisfaction because it is a "good" proxy for "desireability" of job mobility. In contrast, the job-matching and job-searching approaches specifically outline a link between earnigns and mobility, and job-fit and mobility. Hence, in these works, I would argue that satisfaction becomes a more meaningful predictor of mobility, where more specific relationships can be hypothesised. This is especially true with the reservation wage approach, found in the job-search approach. Nonetheless, some faults noted by R3 warrant attention.

* This point is noted. However, my own literature review notes several studies where internal and external mobility lead workers to different results, including Gesthuizen 2009 within the International Journal of Manpower, and Tahlin. R3 cites Jackofsky and L. Peters (1983) when making the point. However, this article focused on the impact of satisfaction on internal and external mobility. It is true that dissatisfaction had a stronger effect on internal mobility; however this is not the point of the current paper. What is more the article makes the assumption "xxxx" which only highlights the importance of my approach in Q&L. Mobley makes an interesting set of observations regarding intention to quit and the cost of quitting, however the approach of the paper is satisfactions' effect on quitting, not the potential effects of quitting on satisfaction. Both the job-matching and job-searching apporaches make explicit predictions about the effects of quitting and promotions. R3 notes the importance of "desire for change" and "opportunity for change". These concepts are important in their own field, but may be less applicable here. 

* This point is noted, I include a brief discussion of involuntary or forced mobility.

* R3 suggests there are several articles which consider the consequences of mobility, but does not include these. They take exception with hypothesis 2. Internal and external mobility will yield different effects on satsifaction and earnings. I cite the work of Tahlin, Gesthuizen, and Pavlopoulos when offering the hypothesis, all such works have found a similar result and have questioned why types of ombility bring about different effects. R3 cites Carnicer, Sanchez, Perez and Jimenez; a paper tha argues that subjective feelings about work are strong predictors of internal mobility. Further, the study is cross-sectional which suggests the authors explore satsifaction as a predictor of movers and non-movers. This paper does not consider the consequences of mobility, and so I find R3's issues slightly confusing.

* This point is noted and accepted, I take greater care in justifying the methodology.

* This point is also accepted, a hausmann test is included which justifies the use of fixed-effects estimation.

* I accept the point regarding practical implications, I expand this section. 

* The point on language is noted; parts of the article have been toned down to accommodate R3.
