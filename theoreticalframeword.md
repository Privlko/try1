# Quits and Ladders: Mechanisms for Improving Outcomes?
July 23, 2018

#### Purpose: 

This study compares internal and external job mobility as mechanisms for improving outcomes.

#### Design/methodology/approach: 

The article uses the British Household Panel Survey. It estimates the effects of quits and promotions using linear fixed-effects methods for the core workforce. 

#### Findings: 

Quits and promotions are distinctly different mechanisms for improving outcomes. External quits improve subjective outcomes, but have no effect on earnings growth. Internal promotions bring earnings growth but have smaller effects on subjective outcomes. The findings shed light on recent debates over what drives "voluntary" mobility; internal mobility may be driven by "skill acquisition", while external mobility may act as a "sorting mechanism" for conditions and job fit.

#### Practical implications:

The promises of highly mobile labour markets should be treated with scepticism. The growth of “boundaryless careers” may act as a release valve for poor working conditions and poor job-fit.

#### Originality/value:

Studies have overwhelmingly focused on the effects quitting, without explicitly comparing this mobility to promotions. This omission gives an incomplete picture of mobility. Our article shows quits and promotions have distinctly different consequences for the core workforce, despite both mobility types being labelled “voluntary”. Focusing on just one form of mobility tells only half the story of mobility and outcomes. The analysis helps to understand inequality in earnings and working conditions; core workers who are able to pursue promotion are rewarded objectively; workers who quit for a new employer seek a better job-fit. 


## Introduction

Job mobility is an important concept in earnings inequality research. Voluntary mobility is supposedly pushed by the promise of better positions elsewhere (Gesthuizen 2009; Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002; Kalleberg and Mastekaasa 2001). This assumption is the basis of both *job-match* and *job-search* theories of mobility, widely used in labour market inequality research (Schmelzer 2016; Jovanovich 1979; Sorensen 197x; Burdett 197x). However, studies of voluntary mobility tend to focus on external mobility alone, ignoring the effects of promotion (Le Grand Tahlin; Kalleberg and Maastekaasa). In these studies authors treat promotions as a form of *immobility*. This approach offers an incomplete picture of mobility types.

The topic of job mobility is underdeveloped in two ways. First, researchers focus most on understanding mobility chances, ignoring the rewards and consequences of mobility (Steenackers 2016; Hachen Jr 1990; Hachen Jr 1992). Second, when exploring the consequences of mobility, authors tend to focus on the impact of quits, and ignore the impact of promotions (Kronberg 2013; Kronberg 2014; Ruiz 2004).

This article compares the effects of internal and external job mobility for the core workforce. Do these mobility types have similar effects, do they carry similar rewards for workers? Beyond this, it estimates mobility's impact on subjective and objective outcomes, in an effort to capture its effects on earnings-growth and job-fit. This approach is informed by recent debates regarding the motivations behind job mobility (Kalleberg and Maou 2018; Steenackers 2016). Does mobility stem from a poor job-fit, or does it stem from a shortfall in wages? 

We use the British Household Panel Survey as a representative sample of British workers. Our approach has three distinct strengths. First, we use explicit measures of quits and promotions. A review of the literature shows that authors often sample and operationalise mobile workers in complex ways, some of which may not be valid (Steenacker 2016; Kalleberg and Mastekaasa; Keith and Williams). Second, we consider outcomes other than objective pay. By including subjective outcomes we capture trade-offs made by workers who change jobs within and between employers (Latzke et al 2012; Dwyer 2004; Kalleberg and Mastekaasa 2001). Third, we accept recent authors' suggestion and use longitudinal data. In this way we explore the effects of moving positions rather than comparing movers to non-movers (Reichelt and Abraham 2017; Cha 2014; Ruiz 2004). 

Two findings are offered. First, voluntary mobility is common; quits and promotions are equally likely and are the dominant form of mobility among the core workforce. Second, internal and external mobility are distinctly different mechanisms with separate effects on outcomes. Internal mobility has the strongest effect on earnings growth, while external mobility has the strongest effect on subjective feelings about work. Crucially, there is no evidence that quits can act as a substitute for promotions in terms of earnings growth. Instead, British workers may be using external mobility to correct for job-fit, instead of attainment as it is described in the literature. In this way, “exit strategies” improve feelings about work; while “loyalty strategies” move workers' careers forward (Hirschman 1982).

The article is structured as follows; section one summarises the theoretical literature, and introduces a key assumption. Section two summarises the empirical articles and introduces three hypotheses. Section three presents our methodology and approach, while section four lists our results. A brief discussion concludes.

## Theoretical framework

Workers are assumed to seek the highest level of compensation possible (Sorensen 1975; Sorensens 1978). Voluntary job mobility may be one strategy to achieve this, wether within firms (gesthuizen; Altahuser and Kalleber; Althauser) or between them (jovanovic;  burdett;  Keith and Williams).

In economics, job mobility is understood by two approaches; the *job-search* approach originally focused on explaining transitions out of unemployment. However Burdett (1978) updated this model to include transitions between positions. It relies on two reservation wages, X and Y (where X<Y). Reservation wage X draws a worker into employment, while reservation wage Y draws a worker to a new position. Mobility between positions can only occur if workers see financial gains; *"An employed worker who is looking for another job will accept any offer received with a wage greater than his current wage"* (Burdett 2010; p212). This suggests mobility is largely driven by the promise of higher wages, or *wage quits*. The *job-mismatch* approach (Jovanovic 1979) sees mobility as stemming from a mismatch between a worker's skill and her earnings or conditions. Since work is essentially an "experience good", workers take time to evaluate whether their productivity fits with their compensation (Ruiz). If there is a mismatch between the two, workers correct this by pursuing new positions (Sorensen 1970; Jovanovic 1970). In this approach too, mobility is assumed the best mechanism to improve worker outcomes.

Sociology also sees mobility as a mechanism which moves workers to "better" jobs. Sørensen (1975: p460) suggests *“A person may be assumed to shift jobs voluntarily if he can obtain a better job”*; while Hachen (1990: p 320) claims *“… in industrial societies, individual attainment… is in large part a function of job changes”*. Since rewards are assumed specific to positions in a labour market, only a change in positions can lead to a change in rewards, or *“different people in the same job will obtain the same rewards… the same person will obtain different rewards in different jobs”* (Aage B Sørensen 1977: p967). 
 
Few of the theories above, especially those of sociology, differentiate between quits and promotions explicitly. Most authors only suggest a relationship between a given position and the next position; the channels which secure this second position are irrelevant. Thus, many of these can easily apply to internal promotions as well as external quits. Despite this, the literature around job mobility has focused heavily on external changes to new employers, suggesting quits are the optimal way of improving outcomes. Whats more, among the few papers which *have* compared internal and external mobility, there is concensus that mobility types lead workers to different outcomes, and at least some evidence that internal mobility yields greater gains than external mobility. We summarise these below.

## Voluntary mobility to “better” positions

Mobility’s consequences are somewhat understudied. Traditionally, authors have focused more on predicting mobility than its effects (Steenacker 2016; Fuller 2008; Pavlopoulos et al. 2007; Ruiz 2004; Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002). Among existing studies, conclusions on the effects of mobility differ depending on whether internal promotions are included. In order to illustrate the point, we split the literature into two camps; first, studies where authors estimate the impact of external quits alone; second, studies which compare and contrast the effects of internal and external mobility. Studies which estimate the effect of quitting, frame quits as mechanisms for improving most outcomes. Studies which compare and contrast internal and external mobility hold different conclusions. Here, internal mobility yields higher objective returns, but lower subjective returns. At the very least, internal and external mobility yield different outcomes for workers, which suggests they make compromises by choosing one form of voluntary movement over another (Kalleberg and Mastekaasa 2001; Gesthuizen and Dagevos 2008; Dwyer 2004). A brief summary follows.

### External mobility

Generally, authors find a positive relationship between external mobility and outcomes. Whether these are subjective (Sallaz 2017; Kalleberg and Mastekaasa 2001) or objective (Kronberg 2013; Kronberg 2014; Cha 2014; Reichelt and Abraham 2017; Ruiz et al 2004), workers who quit move to more favourable positions; even when remaining in a similar occupation (Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002). When workers report some worse outcomes after a move, these are framed as concessions for greater gains in other outcomes. For example, voluntary downward mobility in the US has lead many workers to lower paying positions with greater opportunities or conditions, it is argued (Sallaz 2017; Dwyer 2004).

In terms of objective pay, workers who quit move to higher paying positions (Kronberg 2014; Kronberg 2013; Schmelzer 2012; Ruiz et al. Keith and Williams 197x). The effect is also significant over the long-term, and is increasing for some workers (Latzke et al. 2016; Kronberg 2014). Even when models correct for individual heterogeneity (where certain workers are more likely to quit than others), “economic” quits lead to better paid positions with new employers (Fuller 2008; Keith and Williams). 

There are some caveats to the effect. First, Latzke et al. (2016)  and Schmelzer (2016; 2012; 2010) find that the benefits of external mobility depend largely on direct external mobility, where workers avoid unemployment and move from one position directly to another. Successful transitions from one job to another require workers to search for opportunities *on the job*. Second, there are significant differences between workers in the mobility-outcomes relationship. The positive effect of quitting may be mitigated by worker characteristics, where men benefit from mobility more than women, and white workers gain from mobility more than black workers (kronberg 2014; kronberg 2013). However worker differences are not always replicated in other studies, and generally authors agree that core workers tend to benefit from external mobility (Ruiz et al. 2004; Cha 2012; Fuller 2008). 

In terms of subjective or "soft" outcomes, external mobility also leads to better positions. Sallaz (2017) finds that call centre workers, who hold high-paying jobs without prospects, often take lower paying positions with better conditions. Here, workers are motivated to leave “dead-end” jobs, depending on their ability to do so. Dwyer (2004) too argues that downward wage mobility is an explicit strategy to improve conditions with new employers. In both examples, workers trade poorer pay for better working conditions, a strategy which goes against *job-search* approach, but fits with the *job-matching* approach. Latzke find that external quits to a new employer has a significant effect on both earnings and satisfaction with work, and that the effects have remained strong over time. 

None of the authors consider internal mobility or promotions as a means to improve outcomes, and so they take a limited view of “voluntary” mobility. Despite a decline in tenure and career opportunities (Cappelli Jacoby), internal careers are the main hope for the majority of the core workforce (Riggotti). It is also the *"most desired type of job mobility, because promotions increase status, esteem, responsibilities, and financial rewards"* (Ng et al 2007: p365). How does this mobility type compare with external mobility?

One key reason for the omission in the works above may be related to data. Both Fuller (2008) and Keith and McWilliams (1995) sample young workers from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, where mobility is defined as a split with the firm for family, involuntary, and “other” reasons. None of these categories consider internal mobility. In Germany too, certain mobility captured by the German Socio-Economic Panel may be flawed (Kattenbach et al. 2014), forcing Reichelt and Abraham (2017) to use alternative data, and Schmelzer (2010) to drop internal mobility entirely. Thus, finding data on internal promotions and external job quits is a challenge for authors. Despite this, when internal promotions are included into predictive models, significant differences emerge among outcomes.

### Internal and external mobility patterns

Studies comparing the consequences of quits and promotions are even rarer than the those above. However, twhen authors compare and contrast the effec tof moving, they tend to highlight three wrinkles. First, internal mobility presents stronger and more significant earnings growth than external mobility (le grand tahlin). Second, external mobility presents stronger and more significant effects on subjective outcomes than internal mobility (Gesthuizen2008 2009). Lastly, internal mobility is associated with a mix of positive and negative consequences (Lup 2017, Rigotti. 2007). In short, if workers want to improve outcomes, they may have to consider which are in need of attention before committing to a mobility type. 

When compared, internal promotions yield greater and more significant earnings growth than external job quits (Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002; pavlopoulous; gesthuizen and dagevos). In Sweden Le Grand and Tahlin (2002) compare internal and external mobility, controlling for a variety of biases. They find internal promotion has the strongest effect on earnings, although external movement has a premium too. The effect is also “pure”, in that it remains when controlling for occupations; even when respondents stay in the same occupation, they see earnings growth. In the Netherlands Gesthuizen and Dagevos (2008) find that internal promotion has the strongest effect on objective outcomes like earnings and socio-economic status. As before, external mobility also holds these premiums, but they are far weaker than internal promotion. One caveat to the effect, is that it may rely on the institutional setting of the labour market. Pavlopoulos et al (2007) analyse panel data from the UK and Germany. They agree with Le Grand and Tahlin (2006) in their British results, internal mobility has the strongest effect on British workers' earnings. Howeveer, the findings flip for the German results; external mobility has the strongest effect on German workers' earnings. Generally, when authors compare internal and external mobility, it is internal mobility that rewards objective outcomes best.

Others find that external mobility has the stronger effect on subjective feeelings about work, when compared to internal mobility (Gesthuizen 2008; 2009). In the Netherlands, Gesthuizen (2009) finds external mobility improves several subjective outcomes, while internal mobility has a weak effect on these. Moving to a new employer improves workers evaluation of their job fit, their satisfaction with wages, and their satisfaction with hours. Elsewhere Gesthuizen and Dagevos (2008) again find that external mobility has the strongest effect on subjective feelings about work in several different measures. These papers suggest that subjective feelings about work and the mismatch between a workers expectations and working conditions, is driving mobility.

Lastly, the two sets of findigs above make sense when the full effect of promotions are considered. Typically, respondents who experience promotion report a mix of positive and negative outcomes (Lup, Rigotti). In the UK Lup (2018) finds that women who experience promotions, often report lower working conditions after the transition. In Germany Rigotti (2012) find that upward career transitions are associated with both positive and negative outcomes, with higher career satisfaction, being balanced with increased strain on employees. Thus, it makes sense that promotions would yield stronger earnings growth while having no effect on other subjective measures of working conditions. Here, workers are transitioning to new positions which have new responsibilities and pressures. However, these pressures are often greater than the objective rewards and resources given to workers who experience promotion. Thus internal mobility moves workers to "better" jobs in some outcomes, but leads to compromises elsewhere. 

The results above are mixed; but overall, papers challenge the idea that job mobility is a utilitarian process, which brings workers to “better” positions. There is a lack of studies which consider the impact of both quits and promotions. There is also a lack of studies using outcomes other than pay, which may inform why workers hold interests in quitting and seeking promotions. Part of the bargains in the papers above may force workers to choose between two mechanisms, their wider networks in the external market, or career ladders inside the firm. With this in mind, we propose three hypotheses:

##### Hypothesis 1: Voluntary mobility will improve outcomes
##### Hypothesis 2: Internal mobility and external mobility will yield significantly different effects on outcomes
##### Hypothesis 3: Subjective and objective outcomes will be affected differently by different mobility types
