# Quits and Ladders: Mechanisms for Improving Outcomes?
July 23, 2018

## Abstract
This study compares the consequences of internal and external job mobility. Previous studies have overwhelmingly focused on the effects quitting, without comparing these to promotions. This omission gives an incomplete picture of mobility.  We argue that quits and promotions have distinctly different consequences for the core workforce, despite both mobility types being labelled “voluntary”. Fixed effects regression analysis of the British Household Panel Survey (2000-2008) provides two important findings. First, external quits bring subjective satisfaction with work and working conditions, but have no effect on earnings growth. Second, internal promotions yield earnings growth but bring smaller effects on subjective satisfaction. The article helps to understand the process of inequality in earnings and working conditions; core workers who are able to pursue promotion are rewarded objectively, while workers who quit for a new employer seek better working conditions and working hours. The findings shed light on recent debates over what drives mobility; internal mobility may be driven by "skill acquisition", while external mobility may act as a "sorting mechanism" for conditions and job fit. 

## Introduction

Job mobility is an important concept in earnings inequality research. This is especially true in sociology, where one's outcomes are often tied to one's position in a structure or hierarchy (Kalleberg and Mouw 2018; Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002; Kalleberg and Sorensen 1979; Aage B Sørensen 1975). Voluntary mobility between positions is supposedly pushed by the promise of a better position elsewhere (Kalleberg and Mastekaasa 2001; Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002). This assumption forms the basis of the *life-chances approach*, widely used in labour market inequality research (Golsch 2006; Mills and Blossfeld 2006; Blossfeld, Mills, and Bernardi 2006). Despite the assumption above, studies of voluntary mobility tend to focus on external mobility alone, ignoring the effects of promotions and internal mobility (Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002). 

We argue that the topic of job mobility is underdeveloped in two ways. First, sociology has focused on mobility chances, ignoring the rewards and motivations tied to mobility (Hachen Jr 1990; Hachen Jr 1992). Second, when exploring the consequences of mobility, authors have limited their studies to the effects of quitting (Kronberg 2013; Kronberg 2014). As a result, they present quits as strategies which move workers to "better" jobs. This view obstructs the positive effect of promotion, which fits with the theoretical literature tied to job mobility, but is commonly ignored in the empirical literature.  

In this article, we compare the effects of internal and external job mobility for the core workforce. We also consider mobility's impact on both subjective and objective outcomes in an effort to capture earnings growth and job fit. This approach is informed by recent debates regarding the motivations of job mobility (Kalleberg and Maou 2018). We agree with recent authors who have moved away from comparing mobile and non-mobile workers (Reichelt and Abraham 2017; Cha 2014); but suggest bringing internal careers back into the discussion; internal labour markets are still pursued by the majority of workers in the UK and elsewhere (Jacoby 1999; althauser and kalleberg). If they are in decline it is worth asking if multi-empoloyer careers can replace the rewards offered by internal careers (Cappelli 1999)? Putting the question another way, have the benefits of “exit” replaced the benefits of “loyalty” (Hirschman 1982)? Internal career progress is still the hope of most workers, who prefer tenure and security (THE BUGATTI GUY).

We will use the British Household Panel Survey as a representative sample of the British workforce. Our analysis has three distinct strengths. First, we use explicit measures of quits and promotions. A review of the literature shows that authors often operationalise mobility types in complex ways, some of which may not be valid (Kalleberg and Mastekaasa; Keith and Williams). Second, we consider outcomes other than objective pay. By including subjective outcomes the article captures trade-offs made by workers who change jobs within and between employers (Dwyer 2004; Latzke et al 2012; Kalleberg and Mastekaasa 2001). Third, we use longitudinal data, exploring the effects of moving positions rather than comparing movers to non-movers (reichelt 2017).  

Three distinct findings are also offered. First, mobility is common; the majority of this mobility is “voluntary”. Second, mobility does not affect outcomes evenly; moving positions means compromising between subjective and objective outcomes. Lastly, linked to the previous point, internal and external mobility are separate mechanisms with separate effects on outcomes. Internal mobility has the strongest effect on earnings growth, while external mobility improves satisfaction with work. Results suggest quits and promotions are distinctly different strategies, where promotions lead to attainment and earnings growth (Aage B Sørensen 1975), and quits lead to bargains over the job match and working conditions (kallberg and maouw). Crucially, there is no evidence that promotions and quits have the same impact on outcomes. Instead, British workers may be using external mobility as a release valve for poor conditions. In this way, “exit strategies” improve feelings about work; while “loyalty strategies” move workers’ careers forward (Hirschman 1982).

The article is structured as follows; section one summarises the theoretical literature, and introduces a framework. Section two summarises the empirical work on external and internal mobility, and their relationship to outcomes. Section three presents the methodology and the approach, while section four lists the results. A discussion concludes.

## Theoretical Framework

Sociologists conceptualise the labour market as a series of hierarchies which contain positions (Kalleberg & Mouw 2018; Aage B Sørensen 1977; Aage B Sørensen 1975;). These can be tall or flat (DiPrete et al. 1997), segmented or porous (Acker 2006; Mills and Blossfeld 2006), or firm-based or occupation-based (Althauser 1989; Althauser and Kalleberg 1981). Each position in a hierarchy contains its own economic, social, and psychological rewards specific to that position, and desirable positions are placed at the top of a hierarchy. Workers try to reach desired positions over the course of a “career”, which is itself a series of positions (Kalleberg and Mouw 2018, Tahlin Le Grand). This literature holds a key assumption; the best way to improve work-related outcomes is by moving between positions (Rosenfeld 1992; Aage B Sørensen 1977).

The assumption that mobility occurs only because it is of interest to workers, is extremely important. Sørensen (1975: p460) suggests *“A person may be assumed to shift jobs voluntarily if he can obtain a better job”*; while Hachen (1990: p 320) claims *“… in industrial societies, individual attainment… is in large part a function of job changes”*. If rewards are specific to positions in a labour market, only a change in positions can lead to a change in rewards, or *“different people in the same job will obtain the same rewards… the same person will obtain different rewards in different jobs”* (Aage B Sørensen 1977: p967). In economics too, *search and match* models predict workers are motivated by a reservation wage. Here, workers move from unemployment to employment if the offered wage is higher than their (self-defined) reservation wage (Schmelzer 2012; McCall 1970). Job mobility between positions is also motivated by the same concept, where workers compare their given position to a second position, moving only if the offered wage is greater than the second reservation wage (Schmelzer 2012; Burdett 1978).  Thus, mobility, through quits or promotions, is the best strategy to improve working conditions or pay. 
 
Non of the theories above differentiate between internal and external mobility. Each author only suggests a relationship between a given position and the subsequent position; the channels and mechanisms which are taken to secure the second position are irrelevant. Thus, many of the theories above can easily apply to internal promotions as well as external job quits. Despite this, the discussion around job mobility has focused heavily on external mobility to new employers. Whats more, of the few papers which have compare internal and external mobility types, most resemble separate mechanisms for improving separate outcomes, a conclusion that is often missing from job mobility literature. 

## Voluntary mMbility to “Better” Positions

Mobility’s consequences are somewhat understudied. Traditionally, authors have focused more on predicting mobility than studying its effects (Fuller 2008; Pavlopoulos et al. 2007; Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002). A limitation in existing studies is the strong focus on external mobility alone. In order to highlight this, we split the literature in two camps; first, studies where authors estimate the impact of external quits to a new employer alone; second, studies which compare and contrast the consequences of internal and external mobility. The review shows that studies which estimate the effect of quitting, frame quits as mechanisms for improving outcomes. However, these studies assume that internal mobility has no effect on workers, treating them as no different than years where workers remain in the same job with the same employer. Studies which compare and contrast the impact of internal and external mobility hold different conclusions. Here, internal and external mobility yield different outcomes for workers which suggests they make compromises by choosing one form of voluntary mobility over another (Kalleberg and Mastekaasa 2001; Gesthuizen and Dagevos 2008; Dwyer 2004). Routinely, external exits lead to higher subjective outcomes than promotions. 

Part of this effect could be explained by Sørensen’s (1975) argument that “structures of inequality” differ within and between firms; wages and conditions vary less within the same firm than they do between firms. However, in this explanation, internal mobility should reward workers less than external mobility on every outcome. Yet, mobility types have subtly different effects on subjective and objective outcomes, a feature that is not considered by the “structures of inequality” approach. We start by reviewing studies focused exclusively on external mobility, or quits. 

### External mobility

Generally, authors find a positive relationship between external mobility and outcomes. Whether these are subjective (Sallaz 2017; Kalleberg and Mastekaasa 2001) or objective (Kronberg 2013; Kronberg 2014; Cha 2014; Reichelt and Abraham 2017), workers who quit tend to move to more favourable positions; even when remaining in a similar occupation (Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002). Although some workers lose out in some outcomes after a move, these are generally presented as bargains and compromises for greater gains elsewhere. For example, voluntary downward mobility in the US leads workers to lower paying positions with greater opportunities or greater conditions (Sallaz 2017; Dwyer 2004).

In terms of objective pay, workers who quit typically move to higher earning positions (Kronberg 2014; Kronberg 2013; Schmelzer 2012). The effect is also significant over the long-term, and is increasing for some workers (Latzke et al. 2016; Kronberg 2014). Even when authors correct for worker differences (individual heterogeneity, where certain workers are more likely to change jobs than others), “economic” quits lead to better paid positions with new employers (Fuller 2008; Keith and Williams). There are some caveats to the effect. First, Latzke et al. (2016)  and Schmelzer (2016; 2012; 2010) find that the benefits of external mobility depend largely on direct external mobility, where workers avoid unemployment and move from one position directly to another. Thus successful transitions from one job to another require workers to search for opportunities *on the job*. Second, there are significant differences between workers in the mobility-outcomes relationship. The positive effect of quitting may be mitigated by worker characteristics, where men benefit from mobility more than women, and white workers gain from mobility more than black workers (kronberg 2014; kronberg 2013). However the effects of worker differences are not always replicated (Cha 2012; Fuller 2008), more on this later. 

In terms of subjective and "soft" outcomes, external mobility also leads to better positions, but some caveats appear. Sallaz (2017) finds that call centre workers, who hold high-paying jobs without prospects, often take lower paying positions with better conditions in an effort to leave “dead-end” jobs. Dwyer (2004) too argues that downward wage mobility is an explicit strategy to improve conditions with new employers. In both examples, workers trade poorer pay for better working conditions. Despite this, Latzke find that external quits to a new employer has a significant effect on both earnings and satisfaction with work, and that the effect has remained strong over time. 

Some findings suggest the benefits of external mobility are not equal. For example, Cha (2014) show that only women without family obligations benefit from job mobility. Further, Cha (2014) finds that the effect is highly reliant on stability in the wider economy. Kronberg (2013) too finds that women see smaller earnings growth from external mobility when compared to men, despite moving to traditionally “good” jobs (those with insurance, security, and high wages). Elsewhere, differences in quits premiums also emerge between education groups, although the effect relies heavily on race. Kronberg (2014) finds college-educated white men see an earnings premium after quitting, but white workers without a college education see no such premium. A similar relationship emerges among black men with and without a college education, but the premium for black men is far smaller than white men. In Germany, similar differences can be drawn in terms of class, with professional workers gaining more from quits than clue collar workers (Latzke et al. 2016). These findings suggest that inequality between workers does not just stem from access to quits, but that differences between workers also shape the consequences of quits. However, the "core-workforce" is expected to gain from mobility mechanisms moreso than the periphery.

A number of issues stem from the review. First, none of the authors consider internal mobility or promotions as a means of improving outocmes, and so they provide a limited view of “voluntary” mobility. Here, job mobility is presented only as a move to a new employer. Those in the control group are assumed to remain in the same position with the same earnings and outcomes. Despite a decline in tenure and career opportunities (Cappelli Jacoby), internal careers are the main hope for the majority of the core workforce (Riggotti). Is external job mobility more likely to reward workers than climbing internal career structures? The articles above cannot consider this. 

One of the key reasons for focusing on external mobility alone is related to data. Both Fuller (2008) and Keith and McWilliams (1995) sample young workers from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, where mobility is defined as a split with the firm for family, involuntary, and “other” reasons. None of these categories consider voluntary internal mobility. In Germany too, certain mobility captured by the German Socio-Economic Panel may be flawed (Kattenbach et al. 2014), forcing Reichelt and Abraham (2017) to use alternative data, and Schmelzer (2010) to drop internal mobility entirely. Thus, finding data on internal promotions and external job quits is a challenge for authors. Despite this, when internal promotions are included into predictive models, significant differences begin to emerge among outcomes.

### Internal and external mobility patterns

Studies comparing the consequences of quits and promotions are rare. This is partly due to data limitations, and partly due to the conflation of quits and promotions as both "voluntary" mobility types. These articles break with the theories above in three important ways. First, internal transitions are associated with a mix of positive and negative consequences. For example, workers who move to objectively better positions, can also experience subjectively worse conditions in other measures (Lup 2017, rigotti. 2007). Second, internal promotions often yield significantly different results when compared to external quits for a range of outcomes. Lastly, different mobility types have different effects on subjective and objective outcomes, suggesting quits and promotions are motivated by different goals or strategies. In short, the effects of internal and external mobility are not as clear as those presented by Sørensen (1975). If workers want to improve certain outcomes, like pay, which strategy should they pursue, and what is the return to each?

Internal promotions, on their own, do not constitute better workplace outcomes (Lup, Rigotti). In the UK Lup (2018) finds that women who experience promotions, often report lower working conditions after the transition. In Germany Rigotti (2012) find that upward career transitions are associated with both positive and negative outcomes, with higher career satisfaction, being balanced with increased strain on employees.  Here, workers are transitioning to new positions, which have new responsibilities and pressures, some of which are greater than the objective compensation workers receive for the job.

Despite this, some find that internal promotions yield higher premiums than quits, leading workers to better positions in terms of pay and conditions (Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002; Kalleberg and Mastekaasa 2001). In Sweden Le Grand and Tahlin (2002) show that internal mobility yields significantly stronger earnings growth than external quits. The effect is also “pure”, in that it remains even when controlling for occupational mobility of workers. Ultimately, the authors show that both mobility types act as distinctly different structures of reward, and that internal career ladders reward workers better than external structures. Kalleberg and Mastekaasa (2001) find a similar effect using a set of subjective outcomes. It is internal promotion which rewards workers best, although external changes have some significant effects. 

Other authors comparing internal and external changes find that quits have a stronger effect on outcomes than promotions. In the Netherlands, Gesthuizen (2009) finds hat external mobility improves several subjective outcomes, while internal mobility has weaker effects on workers. Pavlopoulos et al (2007) analyse panel data from the UK and Germany, finding that external mobility has the strongest effect on German workers, while British workers benefit the most from internal mobility. These findings only apply to low-paid workers in both countries, suggesting the most vulnerable benefit from mobility types. Regarding high earners, mobility lead these workers to somewhat lower paid positions, although this is likely the result of bargains over working time, bonuses, and other rewards.

It could also be that internal and external mobility has different effect depending on the outcome chosen, it may be that internal and external mobility are “pushed” by separate mechanisms, with promotions driven by earnings growth, and quits driven by a need to improve working conditions or subjective feelings about work (Gesthuizen 2009; Gesthuizen and Dagevos 2008). Using a Dutch sample, Gesthuizen and Dagevos (2008) find that internal mobility has the strongest effect on objective outcomes, which are status and earnings growth, while external mobility has the strongest effect on subjective feelings about work. Even when controlling for individual heterogeneity, internal promotions are driven by pay and attainment, while external quits are a mechanism for leaving poor work behind. This view also emerges in the US, where downward earnings mobility is a common strategy to improve working conditions and work-life balance (sallaz 2018; Dwyer 2004).

The results above are mixed; but overall, papers challenge the idea that job mobility is a utilitarian process, which brings workers to “better” positions. There is a lack of studies which consider the impact of both quits and promotions. There is also a lack of studies using outcomes other than pay, which may inform the interests workers have in quitting and seeking promotions. Part of the bargaining in the papers above may force workers to choose between two mechanisms, their wider networks in the external market, or career ladders inside the firm. With this in mind, we propose three hypotheses:

### Hypothesis 1: Voluntary mobility will improve outcomes
### Hypothesis 2: Internal mobility and external mobility will yield significantly different effects on outcomes
### Hypothesis 3: Subjective and objective outcomes will be affected differently by different mobility types
