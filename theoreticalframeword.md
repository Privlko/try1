# Quits and Ladders: Mechanisms for Improving Outcomes?
July 23, 2018

## Abstract
This study compares the consequences of internal and external job mobility. Previous studies have overwhelmingly focused on the effects quitting, without comparing such mobility to promotions. This omission gives an incomplete picture of mobility.  We argue that quits and promotions have distinctly different consequences for the core workforce, despite both mobility types being labelled “voluntary”. Fixed effects regression analysis of the British Household Panel Survey (2000-2008) provides two important findings. First, external quits bring subjective satisfaction with work and working conditions, but have no effect on earnings growth. Second, internal promotions yield earnings growth but small effects on subjective satisfaction. The article helps to understand the process of inequality in earnings and working conditions; core workers who are able to pursue promotion are rewarded objectively, while workers who quit for a new employer seek better working conditions and working hours. The findings shed light on recent debates over what drives "voluntary" mobility; internal mobility may be driven by "skill acquisition", while external mobility may act as a "sorting mechanism" for conditions and job fit. 

## Introduction

Job mobility is an important concept in earnings inequality research. This is especially true in sociology, where one's outcomes are often tied to one's position in a structure or hierarchy (Kalleberg and Mouw 2018; Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002; Kalleberg and Sorensen 1979; Aage B Sørensen 1975). Voluntary mobility between positions is supposedly pushed by the promise of a better position elsewhere (Kalleberg and Mastekaasa 2001; Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002). This assumption forms the basis of the *life-chances approach*, widely used in labour market inequality research (Golsch 2006; Mills and Blossfeld 2006; Blossfeld, Mills, and Bernardi 2006). Despite the assumption above, studies of voluntary mobility tend to focus on external mobility alone, ignoring the effects of promotion which is treated as a form of *immobility* (Le Grand Tahlin). 

We argue that the topic of job mobility is underdeveloped in two ways. First, sociology has focused on mobility chances, ignoring the rewards and motivations tied to mobility (Hachen Jr 1990; Hachen Jr 1992). Second, when exploring the consequences of mobility, authors have limited their studies to the effects of quitting (Kronberg 2013; Kronberg 2014). As a result, they present quits as strategies that move workers to "better" jobs. This view obstructs the positive effect of promotion, which fits with the theoretical literature tied to job mobility but is commonly ignored in the empirical literature.  

In this article, we compare the effects of internal and external job mobility for the core workforce. We also consider mobility's impact on both subjective and objective outcomes, in an effort to capture measures of earnings-growth and job-fit. This approach is informed by recent debates regarding the motivations of job mobility (Kalleberg and Maou 2018). Does job mobility stem from a poor job-fit, or are workers trying to correct their objective worth? Beyond this, we ask whether internal and external mobility has the same impact on outcomes. We agree with recent authors who have moved away from comparing mobile and non-mobile workers (Reichelt and Abraham 2017; Cha 2014); but suggest bringing internal careers back into the discussion of job mobility. Internal labour markets are still pursued by the majority of workers in the UK and elsewhere (Jacoby 1999; althauser and kalleberg). If they are in decline it is worth asking, can multi-empoloyer careers replace the rewards offered by internal careers (Cappelli 1999)? Putting the question another way, have the benefits of “exit” replaced the benefits of “loyalty” (Hirschman 1982; bugatti guy)? [NEEDS WORK]

We will use the British Household Panel Survey as a representative sample of the British workforce. Our analysis has three distinct strengths. First, we use explicit measures of quits and promotions. A review of the literature shows that authors often operationalise mobility types in complex ways, some of which may not be valid (Kalleberg and Mastekaasa; Keith and Williams). Second, we consider outcomes other than objective pay. By including subjective outcomes the article captures trade-offs made by workers who change jobs within and between employers (Dwyer 2004; Latzke et al 2012; Kalleberg and Mastekaasa 2001). Third, we use longitudinal data, exploring the effects of moving positions rather than comparing movers to non-movers (reichelt 2017).  

Two distinct findings are also offered. First, voluntary mobility is common; quits and promotions are equally likely and are the dominant form of mobility in the sample. Second, internal and external mobility are distinctly different mechanisms with separate effects on outcomes. Internal mobility has the strongest effect on earnings growth, while external mobility has the strongest effect on subjective working conditions. Crucially, there is no evidence that promotions and quits have the same impact on workers. Instead, British workers may be using external mobility as a release valve for poor conditions. In this way, “exit strategies” improve feelings about work; while “loyalty strategies” move a worker's career forward (Hirschman 1982).

The article is structured as follows; section one summarises the theoretical literature, and introduces a key assumption. Section two summarises the empirical articles and introduces three hypotheses. Section three presents our methodology and approach, while section four lists our results. A brief discussion concludes.

## Theoretical framework

Sociologists conceptualise the labour market as a series of hierarchies which contain positions (Kalleberg & Mouw 2018; Aage B Sørensen 1977; Aage B Sørensen 1975;). These can be tall or flat (DiPrete et al. 1997), segmented or porous (Acker 2006; Mills and Blossfeld 2006), or firm-based or occupation-based (Althauser 1989; Althauser and Kalleberg 1981). Each position in a hierarchy contains its own economic, social, and psychological rewards specific to that position, and desirable positions are placed at the top of a hierarchy. Workers try to reach desired positions over the course of a “career”, which is itself a series of positions (Kalleberg and Mouw 2018, Tahlin Le Grand). This literature holds a key assumption; the best way to improve work-related outcomes is by moving between positions (Rosenfeld 1992; Aage B Sørensen 1977).

The assumption that mobility occurs only because it is of interest to workers is extremely important. In sociology, Sørensen (1975: p460) suggests *“A person may be assumed to shift jobs voluntarily if he can obtain a better job”*; while Hachen (1990: p 320) claims *“… in industrial societies, individual attainment… is in large part a function of job changes”*. If rewards are specific to positions in a labour market, only a change in positions can lead to a change in rewards, or *“different people in the same job will obtain the same rewards… the same person will obtain different rewards in different jobs”* (Aage B Sørensen 1977: p967). In economics too, *search and match* models predict workers are motivated by a (self-defined) reservation wage. Here, job mobility between positions occurs only if a new position's wage exceeds a workers reservation wage (Schmelzer 2012; Burdett 1978).  Thus, mobility, through quits or promotions, is the best strategy to improve working conditions or pay. 
 
None of the theories above differentiate between quits and ladders (internal or external mobility). Each author only suggests a relationship between a given position and the next position; the channels and mechanisms which secure this second position are irrelevant. Thus, many of the theories above can easily apply to internal promotions as well as external job quits. Despite this, the discussion around job mobility has focused heavily on external mobility to new employers. Whats more, of the few papers which have compare internal and external mobility types, most resemble separate mechanisms for improving separate outcomes, a conclusion that is often missing from job mobility literature. We summarise these in the section below.

## Voluntary mobility to “better” positions

Mobility’s consequences are somewhat understudied. Traditionally, authors have focused more on predicting mobility than its effects (Fuller 2008; Pavlopoulos et al. 2007; Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002). A limitation in existing studies is the strong focus on external mobility alone. In order to highlight this, we split the literature in two camps; first, studies where authors estimate the impact of external quits to a new employer alone; second, studies which compare and contrast the consequences of internal and external mobility. The review shows that studies which estimate the effect of quitting, frame quits as mechanisms for improving outcomes. However, these studies treat internal movers as *immobile*, assuming these changes have no effect on workers. Studies which compare and contrast the impact of internal and external mobility hold different conclusions. Here, internal and external mobility yield different outcomes for workers which suggests they make compromises by choosing one form of voluntary mobility over another (Kalleberg and Mastekaasa 2001; Gesthuizen and Dagevos 2008; Dwyer 2004). 

Part of this effect could be explained by Sørensen’s (1975) argument that “structures of inequality” differ within and between firms; wages and conditions vary less within the same firm than they do between firms. However, in this explanation, internal mobility should reward workers less than external mobility on every outcome. Yet, mobility types have subtly different effects on subjective and objective outcomes, a feature that is not considered by the “structures of inequality” approach. We start by reviewing studies focused exclusively on external mobility, or quits. 

### External mobility

Generally, authors find a positive relationship between external mobility and outcomes. Whether these are subjective (Sallaz 2017; Kalleberg and Mastekaasa 2001) or objective (Kronberg 2013; Kronberg 2014; Cha 2014; Reichelt and Abraham 2017), workers who quit move to more favourable positions; even when remaining in a similar occupation (Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002). Even when workers report worse outcomes after a move, these are often framed as a bargaining process where they compromise for greater gains in other outcomes. For example, voluntary downward mobility in the US has lead many workers to lower paying positions with greater opportunities or conditions (Sallaz 2017; Dwyer 2004).

In terms of objective pay, workers who quit typically move to higher paying positions (Kronberg 2014; Kronberg 2013; Schmelzer 2012). The effect is also significant over the long-term, and is increasing for some workers (Latzke et al. 2016; Kronberg 2014). Even when authors correct for individual heterogeneity (where certain workers are more likely to quit than others), “economic” quits lead to better paid positions with new employers (Fuller 2008; Keith and Williams). There are some caveats to the effect. First, Latzke et al. (2016)  and Schmelzer (2016; 2012; 2010) find that the benefits of external mobility depend largely on direct external mobility, where workers avoid unemployment and move from one position directly to another. Successful transitions from one job to another require workers to search for opportunities *on the job*. Second, there are significant differences between workers in the mobility-outcomes relationship. The positive effect of quitting may be mitigated by worker characteristics, where men benefit from mobility more than women, and white workers gain from mobility more than black workers (kronberg 2014; kronberg 2013). However the effects of worker differences are not always replicated (Cha 2012; Fuller 2008), more on this later. 

In terms of subjective or "soft" outcomes, external mobility also leads to better positions. Sallaz (2017) finds that call centre workers, who hold high-paying jobs without prospects, often take lower paying positions with better conditions in an effort to leave “dead-end” jobs. Dwyer (2004) too argues that downward wage mobility is an explicit strategy to improve conditions with new employers. In both examples, workers trade poorer pay for better working conditions. Latzke find that external quits to a new employer has a significant effect on both earnings and satisfaction with work, and that the effect has remained strong over time. 

Some findings suggest the benefits of external mobility are not equal. For example, Cha (2014) show that only women without family obligations benefit from job mobility. Further, Cha (2014) finds that the effect is highly reliant on stability in the wider economy. Kronberg (2013) too finds that women see smaller earnings growth from external mobility when compared to men, despite moving to traditionally “good” jobs (those with insurance, security, and high wages). Elsewhere, differences in quits premiums also emerge between education groups, although the effect relies heavily on race. Kronberg (2014) finds college-educated white men see an earnings premium after quitting, but white workers without a college education see no such premium. A similar relationship emerges among black men with and without a college education, but the premium for black men is far smaller than white men. In Germany, similar differences can be drawn in terms of class, with professional workers gaining more from quits than blue collar workers (Latzke et al. 2016). These findings suggest that inequality between workers does not just stem from access to quits, but that differences between workers also shape the consequences of quits. However, the "core-workforce" is expected to gain from mobility mechanisms moreso than the periphery.

None of the authors consider internal mobility or promotions as a means of improving outcomes, and so they provide a limited view of “voluntary” mobility. Promotions with the same employer are assumed to be a form of immobility. Despite a decline in tenure and career opportunities (Cappelli Jacoby), internal careers are the main hope for the majority of the core workforce (Riggotti). It is also the *"most desired type of job mobility, because promotions increase status, esteem, responsibilities, and financial rewards"* (Ng et al 2007: p365).

One key reason the works above focus on external mobility alone is related to data. Both Fuller (2008) and Keith and McWilliams (1995) sample young workers from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, where mobility is defined as a split with the firm for family, involuntary, and “other” reasons. None of these categories consider voluntary internal mobility. In Germany too, certain mobility captured by the German Socio-Economic Panel may be flawed (Kattenbach et al. 2014), forcing Reichelt and Abraham (2017) to use alternative data, and Schmelzer (2010) to drop internal mobility entirely. Thus, finding data on internal promotions and external job quits is a challenge for authors. Despite this, when internal promotions are included into predictive models, significant differences emerge among outcomes.

### Internal and external mobility patterns

Studies comparing the consequences of quits and promotions are even rarer than the above. This is partly due to data limitations, and partly due to the conflation of quits and promotions as both "voluntary" mobility types. The articles below break with the theories mentioned earlier in three important ways. First, internal mobility presents stronger and more significant earnings growth than external mobility (le grand tahlin). Second, external mobility presents stronger and more significant effects on subjective outcomes than internal mobility (Gesthuizen2008 2009). Lastly, internal mobility is associated with a mix of positive and negative consequences (Lup 2017, Rigotti. 2007). In short, the effects of mobility types do not fit with the idea that movement leads workers to better positions (Sørensen 1975). If workers want to improve outcomes, they may have to consider which are in need of attention before committing to a mobility type. 

When compared, internal promotions yield greater and more significant earnings growth than external job quits (Le Grand and Tåhlin 2002; pavlopoulous). In Sweden Le Grand and Tahlin (2002) show how internal mobility yields greater gross pay than external quits. The effect is also “pure”, in that it remains even when controlling for occupational mobility of workers, meaning that even when respondents stay in the same occupation when changing position, they are rewarded for the change. Kalleberg and Mastekaasa (2001) find a slightly similar effect using a set of subjective outcomes. It is internal promotions which reward workers best, although external changes have significant, but smaller, effects. The effect may rely on the institutional setting of the labour market, Pavlopoulos et al (2007) analyse panel data from the UK and Germany, finding that external mobility has the strongest effect on German workers' earnings, while British workers earnings' benefitted the most from internal mobility. Here, when both mobility types are considered explicitly differences in outcomes emerge for "voluntary" mobility types. 

Other authors comparing internal and external changes find that quits have a stronger effect on subjective feeelings about work, when compared to promotions. In the Netherlands, Gesthuizen (2009) finds external mobility improves several subjective outcomes, while internal mobility has weaker effects on workers' feelings about work. Sallaz documents the process where poor conditions and a lack of opportunity drive call-centre workers to quit their jobs, often for poorer pay and unsatisfactory hours with other employers. Despite the objectively worse conditions, respondents rated their new positions as objectively better. Elsewhere Gesthuizen and Dagevos (2008) find that external mobility has the strongest effect on subjective feelings about work. Even when controlling for individual heterogeneity.

Internal promotions, on their own, do not yield overall better workplace outcomes (Lup, Rigotti). In the UK Lup (2018) finds that women who experience promotions, often report lower working conditions after the transition. In Germany Rigotti (2012) find that upward career transitions are associated with both positive and negative outcomes, with higher career satisfaction, being balanced with increased strain on employees. Here, workers are transitioning to new positions which have new responsibilities and pressures. However, these pressures are often greater than the objective rewards and resources given to workers who experience promotion. Thus internal mobility moves workers to "better" jobs in some outcomes, but leads to compromises elsewhere. 



The results above are mixed; but overall, papers challenge the idea that job mobility is a utilitarian process, which brings workers to “better” positions. There is a lack of studies which consider the impact of both quits and promotions. There is also a lack of studies using outcomes other than pay, which may inform the interests workers have in quitting and seeking promotions. Part of the bargaining in the papers above may force workers to choose between two mechanisms, their wider networks in the external market, or career ladders inside the firm. With this in mind, we propose three hypotheses:

### Hypothesis 1: Voluntary mobility will improve outcomes
### Hypothesis 2: Internal mobility and external mobility will yield significantly different effects on outcomes
### Hypothesis 3: Subjective and objective outcomes will be affected differently by different mobility types
